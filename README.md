# CS_Database
## Purpose of the application
- Library of soucres of information used in CS classes
- Seperate Library of other helpful resources
- Backend code for website that provides basic information (Lecture info, commonly used code and commands)
- /Easy to navigate, single source of information so our laptops dont crash because of the thousands of tabs we have opened

## Page organization
- Sections (eg. Java (important methods and important objects eg file objects, exception objects etc.), Data structures, file structure (relative path absolute path etc.), algorithms, operators(eg. loops, lambda, ?), Python, HTML)
- Topics (eg. RedBlackTrees is a topic under the section Data structure)
- Collapsable list of code blocks that are often used (eg. Delimited string -> array, traversing)
- Collapsable list of common syntaxes for each language

## Code
### Data
- Markdown .txt files stores information which is then loaded to HTML files for display
### Backend
- Adding and updating information
- Loading Markdown files to HTML 
### Frontend
- CSS code to standardize display
- Website navigation

## Crap to do
1. Try to have a main website and one info page (preferrably about a data structure we've just learnt) to test the process of using Markdown -> HTML conversion
2. Write down everything we've ever learnt in Markdown
3. Write CSS code to make it look pretty
