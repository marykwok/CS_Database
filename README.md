# CS_Database

## Purpose of the application

- Library of soucres of information used in CS classes
- Seperate Library of other helpful resources
- Backend code for website that provides basic information (Lecture info, commonly used code and commands)
- /Easy to navigate, single source of information so our laptops dont crash because of the thousands of tabs we have opened

## Page organization

- Topics (eg. RedBlackTrees is a topic under the section Data structure)
- Collapsable list of code blocks that are often used (eg. Delimited string -> array, traversing)

## Code

### Data

- Markdown .txt files stores information which is then loaded to HTML files for display

### Backend

- Adding and updating information
- Loading Markdown files to HTML 
- How to sync and update the files and page being run on rasberry pie and laptops

### Frontend

- CSS code to standardize display
- Website navigation

## Crap to do

1. Try to have a main website and one info page (preferrably about a data structure we've just learnt) to test the process of using Markdown -> HTML conversion
2. Write down everything we've ever learnt in Markdown
3. Write CSS code to make it look pretty
